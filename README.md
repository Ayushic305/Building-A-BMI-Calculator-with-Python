# Building-A-BMI-Calculator-with-Python
The BMI Calculator is a Python program designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of an individual based on their weight and height. 
The program takes user input for weight in kilograms and height in meters. Using the BMI formula (BMI = weight / (height * height)), the program then computes the BMI value. 
Additionally, the program provides a categorical interpretation of the calculated BMI value, classifying it into categories such as 'Underweight', 'Normal Weight', 'Overweight', and 'Obese', 'Severly Obese' along with a corresponding health message. 
The BMI calculator serves as a simple tool to assess whether an individual's weight is proportionate to their height and provides basic insights into their overall health status.
